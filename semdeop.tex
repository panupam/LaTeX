\opening{Sir,}
I have been addicted to Netflix for around a year now. Things escalated fast for normal to worst by passing days. I thought I can battle it by myself but it didn't happened. I tried many times but after a few days it became much worst and this cycle continued. This affacted my academic a lot. At this point it seems it can not be treated by myself. I talked to our department counsellor and our head of department. According to them, at this point, semester drop and treatment with Dr. Alok Bajpayi for the addiction seems only option as  otherwise I might get terminated. \par Sir considering all these things kindly grant me semester drop for this semester. Thanks.
\closing{Regards}
